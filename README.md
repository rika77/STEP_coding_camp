# STEP coding camp
A hackathon in April, 2018.
We developed a Google Home app called Walkure.
If we ask a question to Walkure, Walkure does not answer questions obediently.
Instead, Walkure replys with questions, which makes people think.

Example:
We: "What is the tallest tower in Japan?"
Walkure: "Which is tallest, Tokyo Tower, Sky Tree and Roppongi Hills?"
We: "Roppongi Hills"
Walkure: "No, the answer is Sky Tree."

We can memorize things easily not just by being answered immediately, but by this kind of communication.
